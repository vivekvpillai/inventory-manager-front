#Final-Project-GA: Usage Insights

This was my first attempt at using Java Spring Boot. I connected the Java Spring Boot backend to the React frontend.

#User Stories

The users will be able to add data from consumer usage, and edit/delete the data, into the public page. This is through the React frontend, communicating to the backend CRUD Java Spring/Boot backend.
The data will collect below the data listing bar. This will be used in a single page React application.
MVP: User Stories + Portfolio Quality Styling.

#Future Goals

The usage statistics will implement chart.js graphs for consumer usage for the days, using timestamps. The logged in users can add data connected to their username. If mounts of visits for a data listing below are less than 1000, the border for the data listing will be red, and if not, the border will be green. Link usage to a website, such as a previous project, for real-time data.
Implement redux/Regex.

#Takeaways

I learned and implemented the basics of Java in this project. I was able to understand the concept of Java beans, Java Spring Boot, and how objected oriented programming is applied in Java. I was able to debug many issues when starting my Java Spring Boot application, which was causing my initial maven boot to fail at first, and solving them helped me better understand how Java Spring Boot worked. I was able to move past issues in debugging the React frontend causing my data to not list, such as sneaky camelCase discrepancy issues with my variables, which of course was a long journey (on camel top), but I was able to solve these issues and allow my data to populate. This project was a fun way to get introduced to Java Spring Boot!
