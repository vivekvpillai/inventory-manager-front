This project uses Java Spring Boot backend with a ReactJS frontend.

#User Stories

The users will be able to add data from consumer usage, and edit/delete the data, into the public page. This is through the React frontend, communicating to the backend CRUD Java Spring/Boot backend.
The data will collect below the data listing bar. This will be used in a single page React application.
MVP: User Stories + Portfolio Quality Styling.

#Future Goals

The usage statistics will implement chart.js graphs for consumer usage for the days, using timestamps. The logged in users can add data connected to their username. If mounts of visits for a data listing below are less than 1000, the border for the data listing will be red, and if not, the border will be green. Link usage to a website, such as a previous project, for real-time data.
Implement redux/Regex.
